I used ChatGPT (GPT-4) to help me understand C# programming concepts, refactor my C# code, and write clear documentation.

My AI prompts were:

"Give example for C# problem with following approaches: 'Start with a working prototype, refactor and polish it into something excellent, deliver code that’s ready for a collaborative team environment.'"

"How to make test cases for C# program?"

"Can you refactor and document the C# code [code]"
