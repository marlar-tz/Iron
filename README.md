# Old Phone Keypad Converter

### Introduction
A simple C# console app that simulates typing text on an old mobile phone keypad (multi-tap input). 
It interprets number sequences like 44 33 555 555 666# and converts them into readable text such as HELLO.

### Features
- Multi-tap input: Maps numeric key presses (e.g., 2, 22, 222) to letters (A, B, C).

- Backspace (*): Deletes the last entered character.

- Pause (0): Inserts a space between words.

- End (#): Finalizes the message.

- Special characters: 1, 11, 111, 1111 → &'()

### Overview
| Input                | Output |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| `222 2 22#`          | CAB    |
| `44 33 555 555 666#` | HELLO  |
| `8 666 666 0 3 33#`  | TOO DE |
| `222 2*22#`          | CB     |

### How it works
The program reads a sequence of keypad inputs (e.g., 44 33 555 555 666#).

- When digits repeat (like 666), they map to letters (O).

- When the digit changes, the program finalizes the previous letter and starts a new one.

- Spaces act as pauses between letters.

- Pressing * deletes the last character.

- Pressing # ends the sequence.

### Pseudocode (Old Phonepad Logic)
```
result = ""
sequence = ""
FOR each character in input:
    if char == '#':
        map sequence and stop
    else if char == ' ':
        map sequence and reset sequence
    else if char == '*':
        remove last character from result
    else if char is digit:
        append char to sequence
        if next char is different:
            map sequence to character
            reset sequence
END FOR
RETURN result

```

### How to Run
Tests are included inside the Main function using a custom AssertTest() method.

1. Open Visual Studio

2. Create a new Console App (.NET) project

3. Copy the provided code into your Program.cs

4. Open terminal and type 'dotnet run'

5. View test results in the console or enter your own keypad input.
